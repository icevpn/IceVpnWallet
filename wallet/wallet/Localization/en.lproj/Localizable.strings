Reason: iOS devices have a 15M NE memory limit, and when connecting to VPN, the VPN connection will be disconnected if the memory limit exceeds 15M.
Solution:
It is recommended to upgrade the iOS system to iOS 15, which will increase the memory limit from 15M to 50M.
Clear unused programs in the background, and turn off settings such as automatic syncing of photos and automatic updates from the app store.
PS: The 15M NE memory limit for iOS is an Apple-imposed limit. You can search for \"iOS 15M NE memory limit\" on Google for more information.
